            <h2>Gym & Lifting</h2>
            <p>Lifting weights and going to the gym are lifestyle choices that enhance physical strength, mental toughness, and discipline. 
                In and out of the gym, it's about pushing yourself, making goals, and reaching personal bests. 
                Whether your goal is strength, appearance, or general health, this path builds confidence and a sense of success. 
                It is a really fulfilling endeavor, as the gym turns into a place of self-improvement where effort and commitment provide tangible benefits.

            <p>
                It is a place where people can grow mentally and physically. 
                Pushing past comfort zones to discover new potential is symbolized by each repetition, set, and drop of sweat. 
                Lifting is about developing a mindset of tenacity and self-improvement, not just about building muscle.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I started lifting three years ago when I was a senior in high school.
                I was overweight and wanted to lose weight.
                I wanted to make a change for the better, so I started researching how to lose weight and what foods help with weight loss.
                My friend introduced me to his gym and offered to take me every day to help me lose weight.
                After a year, I got the hang of things and learned how to track calories and when to increase the weight.
                I started looking up to people like Sam Sulek.
                Lifting has helped me outside the gym by improving my focus in school and developing discipline.
                I began to procrastinate less, and it has kept me busy with many extracurricular activities.

            <p>The best times thay I like ot work out is around 12:00 pm or at 10:00pm. 
                I like to lift at 12:00pm becuase it get to see my friends and talk and lift with them.

                I sometimes like to lift at 10:00pm becuase there ar some days that I just want to be alone to 
                lift and it is also the best time where there is no one at the gym but yourself.
