            <h2>Gym & Lifting</h2>
            <p>Lifting weights and going to the gym are lifestyle choices that enhance physical strength, mental toughness, and discipline. 
                In and out of the gym, it's about pushing yourself, making goals, and reaching personal bests. 
                Whether your goal is strength, appearance, or general health, this path builds confidence and a sense of success. 
                It is a really fulfilling endeavor, as the gym turns into a place of self-improvement where effort and commitment provide tangible benefits.

            </figure>
            <p>
                It is a place where people can grow mentally and physically. 
                Pushing past comfort zones to discover new potential is symbolized by each repetition, set, and drop of sweat. 
                Lifting is about developing a mindset of tenacity and self-improvement, not just about building muscle.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I started lifting three years ago when I was a senior in high school.
                I was overweight and wanted to lose weight.
                I wanted to make a change for the better, so I started researching how to lose weight and what foods help with weight loss.
                My friend introduced me to his gym and offered to take me every day to help me lose weight.
                After a year, I got the hang of things and learned how to track calories and when to increase the weight.
                I started looking up to people like Sam Sulek.
                Lifting has helped me outside the gym by improving my focus in school and developing discipline.
                I began to procrastinate less, and it has kept me busy with many extracurricular activities.

            <p>The best times that I like to work out are around 12:00 pm or at 10:00 pm. 
                I like to lift at 12:00 pm because I get to see my friends and talk and lift with them.

                I sometimes like to lift at 10:00 pm because there are some days that I just want to be alone to 
                lift and it is also the best time when there is no one at the gym but yourself.

            <h2>How to Start Lifting</h2>
            <p>Weightlifting can be a great way to build strength, improve health, and boost confidence. If you're new to it, here's a simple and effective way to start your journey:</p>
        
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Set Clear Goals</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identify your goal: Do you want to build muscle, increase strength, or improve endurance?</li>
                        <li>Track progress to stay motivated.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Learn Proper Form</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start with lighter weights to master technique.</li>
                        <li>Focus on posture: Keep your back straight, engage your core, and control the movement.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Start With Compound Movements</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These exercises work multiple muscle groups and build foundational strength.</li>
                        <li>Examples: Squats, deadlifts, bench press, and rows.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Create a Routine</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Begin with 2-3 weightlifting sessions per week.</li>
                        <li>Allow rest days in between to give muscles time to recover.</li>
                        <li>Choose a full-body workout or split routines (upper/lower body, push/pull).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Progress Gradually</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start with manageable weights and gradually increase as you get stronger.</li>
                        <li>Aim for 8-12 reps per set to build muscle endurance and strength.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Warm-Up and Cool Down</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Always start with a dynamic warm-up (light cardio and mobility exercises) to prevent injury.</li>
                        <li>Finish with a cool-down to stretch and help with recovery.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Nutrition and Hydration</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Proper nutrition supports muscle growth and recovery.</li>
                        <li>Stay hydrated and fuel your body with protein, carbs, and healthy fats.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Consistency is Key</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Weightlifting is a long-term commitment. Stay consistent, listen to your body, and be patient with your progress.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>By following these steps, you'll build strength and confidence safely and effectively. Stay dedicated, and enjoy the process!</p>

            <h2>Why You Should Lift</h2>
            <p>Lifting has advantages that extend beyond appearance. Although a lot of individuals think that lifting weights will help them gain muscle and look better, there are many additional benefits as well. 
                Strength exercise on a regular basis can improve posture, increase bone density, and lower the chance of injury. 
                In addition to helping to improve mental health by lowering stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, it also increases metabolism, which can aid in weight management. 
                Strength training can also enhance general functionality, flexibility, and endurance, all of which can lead to a better quality of life.
